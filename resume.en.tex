% Introduktion
%==============================================================================

\section{Summary}
I am a T-shaped backend developer with a solid knowledge of creating large-scale software systems for more than 25 years. My primary strengths and interests are the ability to bridge business and IT and use the knowledge to create business and customer value continuously using intelligent tech choices. Furthermore, I am well-versed in modern, agile software development principles and processes. I am comfortable with both devops and support operations and use that feedback to build more robust systems. My main experience is with mathematically based software in the areas of finance, optimization, and supply chain management. I have extensive domain knowledge in the areas of pension funds and life insurance (7 years), banking and capital markets (13 years), and Enterprise Resource Planning systems (5 years). I have also worked as a project manager, scrum master, and solution architect.\\[0.2cm]
